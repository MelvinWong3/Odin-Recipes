<h2>Butter-Basted Rib Eye Steaks</h2>
<p>Rib eye steak can seem intimidating to cook, but this recipe couldn't be simpler. Based on a recipe from Alain
    Ducasse, this rib eye steak method has essentially two parts: seasoning the meat well and letting it stand at
    room
    temperature for at least half an hour, and then cooking them in a hot cast iron skillet. Halfway through
    cooking,
    these bone-in rib eyes are basted with a mixture of butter, thyme and garlic that's already in the skillet, so
    they're crusty outside and richly flavored. And don't worry about any special equipment. For these ribeyes, all
    you
    need is a sturdy pan and a spoon.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the meat stand at room
            temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the canola oil until shimmering. Add the steaks and cook over high
            heat
            until crusty on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and add the butter, thyme, garlic and
            rosemary
            to the skillet. Cook over high heat, basting the steaks with the melted butter, garlic and herbs, until
            the
            steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for
            10
            minutes. Cut the steaks off the bone, then slice the meat across the grain and serve.</li>
